# MyGists

Individual functions from my [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/PanosGreg)

## Overview
When someone clicks on my profile, he can see the repos which are usually complete PowerShell modules.  
But I also have a few individual functions outside of modules, which are found in my GitHub Gists.  
Since a user's Gists are not directly shown, and are somewhat hidden, I've created this repo with links to those functions for visibility.

## Gists
